The Failure Time of 50 Components (10^3 hours)
Information criteria are tools used to demonstrate a distribution's flexibility and effectiveness in representing realistic data by comparing it to the performance of other distributions. Some of these criteria, such as the AIC, AICc, BIC, and HQIC, will be applied to a data set representing, the data represents the failure time of 50 components (10^3 hours), as it is complete data with a rightward skewed nature.
